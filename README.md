# Housing_prices Project

For this project I will try to find the best machine learning model that can predict the housing prices.

# Summary of the solution:
## 1. Data overview:
   1. Data type
   2. Number of columns and rows
   3. Find missing values and fill missing values
      * Label encoder
      * Frequency encoder
   4. Data description and statistical summary
   5. Find outliers and drop them
## 2. Data Analysis Exploration (EDA)
   1. Pairplot and correlation heatmap
   2. Boxplot for bathrooms and prices
   3. Boxplot for bedrooms and prices 
   4. Boxplot for carspots and prices
   5. Boxplot for housing type and prices
   6. Housing price Distribution
## 3. Setting up the data for machine learning
   1. Data train test split
       * Sklearn.cross_validation
   2. Model train
       * Linear Regression Model
       * Decision Tree Regressor Model
       * Random Forest Regressor Model
## 4. Model predection
## 5. Model evaluations
   * Score
   * Mean Absolute Error
